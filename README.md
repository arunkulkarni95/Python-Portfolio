A portfolio of work done in Python.

This currently includes:

-Work done with the Baltimore Data Science Corps funded by the NSF: importing, cleaning, and analyzing COVID-19, Household Income, and Population along with spatial data from the City of Baltimore

-A project in which I set-up a honeypot server in a VM and imported/analyzed attack data.
